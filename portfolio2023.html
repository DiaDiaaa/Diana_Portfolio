            <h3 class = "center-text">Introduction</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Fear often stems from the unknown, the disruption of norms, and concerns over uncontrollable events, which are all part of human survival instincts. In this game, players assume the role of a D-class member caught in a chaotic breakout, forced to confront various anti-human SCP entities. To safely escape, players must navigate through perilous shelters, interact with various SCP entities, make crucial decisions, and solve puzzles. My friend Zixin Ou and I co-designed this game based on the SCP universe.</p>

            <p>The game employs a link navigation and dialogue choice system to guide players in interacting with SCP entities. Throughout the game, players will encounter numerous potentially harmful SCP entities, such as SCP 173, SCP 096, SCP 939, SCP 682, SCP 053, SCP 0294, SCP 035, SCP 073, SCP 953, SCP 847, SCP 860, and SCP 458. Players' choices will determine the game's outcome, leading to either successfully avoiding danger or facing unfavorable endings. This linked structure makes the game more dynamic, providing players with decision-making agency in survival scenarios.</p>

            <h3 class="center-text">Introduction</h3>
            <p>Nights, the profound darkness, intertwine with moods, bringing loneliness. Those who are plagued by nightmares, and trouble of sleep night after night, accompany this heavy solitude.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dreams, are vessels of our emotions and memories, secret mirror that glimpses into the depths of the heart, offering another kind of illusory yet genuine life experience. We are ourselves or any creature in the universe of dreams. Through ever-changing perspectives, we explore forgotten memories and seek the true meaning of ourselves in life.</p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="center-text">Core Mechanic</h3>
            <p> The core mechanics would include running, jumping, changing form, and collecting that allow players to travel around in the wonderland. The character will also be able to make a double jump move, allowing them to reach a higher place in the world. At each level, the character is required to collect all the memories scattered around the world to pass them on to the other world. Hence, the character will need to use a dreamcatcher to collect their memories and transform into a cat to recover the memories stuck in small areas. To pass each level, the player needs to collect all three memories.</p>

            <p>In traditional Chinese culture, Zhou Gong's Dream Interpretation (周公解梦) is a custom that predicts fortune or misfortune based on individual dreams. Each scene in a dream symbolizes a specific hexagram.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the first level, we see a blurry icy surface with a background that resembles a deep cave, reflecting the protagonist's confusion and isolation. According to Zhou Gong's Dream Interpretation, dreaming of ice suggests that soft water, after freezing, gains the ability to withstand pressure, symbolizing that you are about to receive care and support from the most crucial person in your life.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The theme of the second level is a jungle, with its color tones warmer than the first level, indicating that the protagonist is gradually moving in the right direction. Dreaming of a dense forest suggests that your life will experience normal fluctuations, implying that your life will progress along its regular path, hinting at a future of happiness and prosperity. Therefore, we chose green and yellow as the main colors to showcase the harmonious beauty of nature.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The third level represents a desert. Dreaming of a desert symbolizes that at this moment, you may feel lost. The imagery of the desert might prompt players to unveil deeper meanings or truths hidden beneath complex appearances. This level is the most challenging, intended to remind players that they are approaching the conclusion of the story.</p>

            <p>In the ancient legends of the Native Americans, when night falls, various dreams wander through the dark night. Sweet dreams breeze through, traversing the dream web and softly landing on the sleeping person. Nightmares, on the other hand, are captured by the Dream Catcher, waiting for the break of dawn when sunlight pierces through, causing them to dissipate. This ensures that people have peaceful nights, accompanied by sweet dreams. Thus, the player's weapon is the dreamcatcher, used to capture lost memories within dreams.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Cats hold unique symbolic meanings in cultures around the world, often seen as mysterious and independent beings. In Chinese culture, cats carry significant dual symbolism. Their nocturnal habits and independence are associated with connections to the underworld, and some even consider them representatives of evil forces. However, cats are also seen as symbols of "warding off evil" due to their excellent mouse-catching abilities. Beneath their adorable appearance, those deep, mysterious eyes seem to hide endless secrets. The protagonist in the game takes on the form of a cat in the dream world, reflecting the duality between reality and dreams.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The enemies in the game resemble ghosts with Medusa-like braids on their heads. Approaching them causes harm, and if repeatedly attacked, the player will be forever trapped in the dream, unable to wake up, leading to a failure in the game.</p>
