                        <p>In the dynamic world of game development, my journey took an exciting turn during a rapid prototype course, where the idea of creating a beatbox system triggered by mouse clicks emerged. This concept was born out of an inspiring brainstorming session with my teammates, drawing parallels between a captivating game and a music visualizer I had coded in the Summer of 2020. The vision further evolved with inspiration from a colleague's artistic project involving magnetic fields and mouse interaction. This fusion led to the conception of a unified, one-button game that incorporated these diverse elements, promising an innovative and immersive player experience.</p>
                        <h3 class="center-text">Playthrough Presentation</h3>
                        <div class="cute-button-container">
                            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zLgFEqTXab9ze0B_d5ocjYFw-PIhCTze/view?usp=drive_link" class="cute-button">Play</a>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>The central query driving my prototype was straightforward yet ambitious: "How can a one-button game harmoniously integrate elements from a game, a music visualizer, and a colleague's magnetic-field project?" The answer lay in the prototype's revelation. Integration transformed functionality and user experience. Elements from the game introduced engaging interaction, letting players intentionally contribute to the beat. The music visualizer elements brought dynamic and responsive visual feedback, syncing with the rhythm. Inspired by my colleague's magnetic fields, the game added a captivating visual intensity, creating an immersive and visually stimulating experience. The outcome was not just a game; it was a harmonious blend where a single click orchestrated a symphony.</p>
                        <p>Yet, the journey to harmonize these inspirations into a one-button game wasn't without challenges. Positioning arrow characters on the screen became a nuanced struggle, demanding refinement for a seamless player experience. An unexpected realization dawned during implementation—I yearned to enhance visualization further with particles. However, limitations within the current library prompted me to explore alternative solutions and libraries to align the game closer with my vision.</p>
                        <p>"One Button Harmony" evolved through revisions, transforming into a green light-red light dynamic. A click on yellow and green lights brought points, while the red light deducted them. To elevate this one-button symphony, I am committed to refining the arrow character positioning, ensuring an intuitive and fluid user interaction. My dedication to exploring advanced particle effects aims to augment the visual experience, immersing players deeper into the harmonious world created by a simple, yet powerful, click.</p>

                        <p>"A Wonderful Week" is a horror dating simulator, immersing players in the role of a psychologist treating Jennifer, who struggles with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). The game delves into a complex narrative where the player must navigate the delicate balance of earning trust and favorability from Jennifer's dual personalities—a benevolent side and a malevolent devil side. As the psychologist, you must unravel hidden truths, all while avoiding the peril of the devil side's murderous intentions. The game culminates in various endings based on the player's choices and the level of trust cultivated with Jennifer.</p>

                        <p>To enhance the narrative, we employed CSS formatting in the HTML version, assigning colors to characters for clarity. Easter eggs and hidden messages, represented by different colors, add intrigue. In Cthulhu-inspired elements, we integrated R'lyeh language, symbols in the commercial list, and interactive fourth-wall-breaking moments with Hastur, creating a unique and immersive experience.</p>

                        <p>The overall design concept draws inspiration from the lighthearted nature of Solitaire, aiming to convey a sense of sweetness and playful entertainment. The combination of fonts, Baloo and Montserrat, contributes to this by blending round edges for a playful look (Baloo) with straight edges for visual contrast (Montserrat).</p>

                        <p>Taking the same game, Solitaire, the interactive poster ideation introduces a simplified yet engaging approach. Nine cubes, representing the letters in "Solitaire," use a candy color palette, providing a visually appealing and vibrant display. The interactive journey unfolds with cursor movement triggering dynamic color changes in the cubes. Pressing a cube reveals the corresponding letter ("S") with accompanying minion sound effects, mimicking the tactile experience of pressing buttons on a phone dial pad. Additional interaction includes pressing cubes corresponding to the letter "I," unveiling little figures subtly hinting at Solitaire being a card game. The culmination involves pressing all letters or cubes, bringing two little figures together, with remaining information appearing to conclude the interactive poster experience.</p>
